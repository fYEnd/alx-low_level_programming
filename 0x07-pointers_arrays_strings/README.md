0-memset.c
A function that fills memory with a constant byte.

Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
_memeset() fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by swith the constant byte b.
Returns pointer to the memory area s.
1-memcpy.c
A function that copies memory area.

Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);.
n bytes from memory area src are copied to memory area dest.
Returns a pointer to dest.
2-strchr.c
A function that locates a character in a string.

Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);.
Returns a pointer to the first occurence of the character c in the string s or NULL if the character is not found.
3-strspn.c
A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);.
Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept.
4-strpbrk.c
A function that searches a string for any set of bytes.

Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);.
This function loctaes the first occurence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.
Returns a pointer to the bytes in s that matches one of the bytes in accept or NULL if no such bytes is found.
5-strstr.c
A function that loctaes a substring.

Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
This function finds the first occurence of the substring needle in the string haystack.
the terminating null bytes ( \0) are not compared.
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
7-print_chessboard.c
A function that prints a chessboard.

Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);
8-print_diagsums
A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);
Standard library is used.
